# Demo Post

This is a sample article to illustrate how the repository is organized.

## Motivation

Explain the context for the article and why the topic matters. Keep the Markdown simple so it can be reused for Medium. Use reference-style image links to keep the prose clean:

## Rust Example

```rust
use demo_post::example;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", example());
}
```

## Python Example

```python
from example import example

print(example())
```

## Next Steps

- Replace this sample content with your real article.
- Add supporting assets to `articles/demo-post/assets/`.
- Update code examples under `code/` and keep them tested.
